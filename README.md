# traceboy

Traceboy is a **super simple Python script for sidetone**.

It spawns a quick little Qt6 window that lets you press '**Start Sidetone**' to start sidetone, and '**Stop Sidetone**', to stop sidetone.

It takes its mic input from your **default system mic**, and streams it out of your system's **default sound output** (speakers, headphones, etc.).

## Installation

*You'll likely need to **make a Python venv (virtual environment)** that you can activate, then **install theese Python packages inside that**.*

*The likes of **Linux desktops** often have Python **warn against installing random packages to your system Python installation** for obvious reasons.*

--

You'll just need to grab the following Python packages:
- **`sounddevice`** (```pip install sounddevice```)
- **`numpy`** (```pip install numpy```)
- **`scipy`** (```pip install scipy```)
- **`PyQt6`** (```pip install PyQt6```)

and make sure that a package called **`portaudio`** is installed on your host system:
- Example for Arch Linux and derivatives: ```sudo pacman -S portaudio```

--

### Example commands for setting up dependencies on Ubuntu
This should be about everything you need:

```sudo apt install python3-pyaudio libportaudio2```

```pip install sounddevice numpy pyqt6```

--

## Usage

- Run **`main.py`**, the main script:

  - ```cd traceboy```

  - ```python3 main.py```

--

## Known issues

- It is **a little temperemental when closing** if this is interrupting a test, or, to a lesser degree, a sidetone stream
- There is **no built-in visual indicator** to display **when the Repeat After Me test is recording** and playing back sound
